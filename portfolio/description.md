# Example

##  Abstract Shape #1, 1200x1200px, Digital, 2024
### Adobe Illustrator, Class Project, Individual, No AI Tools
For this project we were asked to create abstract designs in Adobe Illustrator using the concepts of Line, Shape, Texture and Color. This piece represents my Shape design. During this assignment, I learned how to use the pen and blob brush tools in Adobe Illustrator. In the future I would like to learn to use more advanced shading techniques. This project pushed me to explore black and white abstract design which was completely outside of my comfort zone.
# FAQ

## How do I determine the size of my image?
* Pressing ⌥ ⌘ I  while selecting a file in the Finder will bring up the Inspector. (or File > Show Inspector from the Menu Bar)
* From here you can find the file size (here: 3 MB, and the image dimensions 1333x2000 px)
