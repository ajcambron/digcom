## Organize (File Management)
1. Create a Project Directory (Folder) in your Google Drive `Google Drive/My Drive/Digital Design/YYYY-MM PROJECT NAME`
2. Try to keep all of your project files for this project together, so your work is not interrupted due to technical issues. 

{: .warning }
Storing all your files in the `/Downloads` folder in your computer is a BAD idea. If any of these files are lost/deleted you will have to reconnect them. Put them in your project folder directly. This will also be helpful in the event of any computer issues.

3. In your project directory, maintain subdirectories for every category of resource you will be using.

|------|
|YYYY-MM Project Name|
|📁 Graphics|
|📁 Sketches|
|📁 Photos|
|📁 Notes|

4. It's also good to include directories for related files
