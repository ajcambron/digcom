## Organize
1. Create a Project Directory (Folder) in your Google Drive ``Google Drive/My Drive/Digital Design/YYYY-MM Project Name``
2. Try to keep all of your project files for the explainer video together, so your work is not interrupted due to technical difficulties.
3. In your project directory, maintain subdirectories for every category of resource you will be using.

{: .warning }
Storing all your files in the `/Downloads` folder in your computer is a BAD idea. If any of these files are lost/deleted you will have to reconnect them. Put them in your project folder directly. This will also be helpful in the event of any computer issues.


|------|
|YYYY-MM Project Name|
|📁 Source Footage|
|📁 Graphics|
|📁 Sound Effects|
|📁 Music|
|📁 Script|

4. It's also good to include directories for related files

|------|
|📁 Project Files|
|📁 Exports|

5. While editing your project, it will benefit you to right click on your project folder and select: "Make Available Offline". This will keep your files stored on the local computer while you are editing. When you are finished editing the project, you can deselect this to free up space on your harddrive.
