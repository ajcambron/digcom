## Organize
1. Create a Project Directory (Folder) in your Google Drive ``Google Drive/My Drive/Digital Design/YYYY-MM Project Name``
2. Try to keep all of your project files for the explainer video together, so your work is not interrupted due to technical difficulties.
3. In your project directory, maintain subdirectories for every category of resource you will be using.

|------|
|YYYY-MM Project Name|
|📁 Source Footage|
|📁 Graphics|
|📁 Sound Effects|
|📁 Music|
|📁 Script|

4. It's also good to include directories for related files

|------|
|📁 Project Files|
|📁 Exports|

5. While editing your project, it will benefit you to right click on your project folder and select: "Make Available Offline". This will keep your files stored on the local computer while you are editing. When you are finished editing the project, you can deselect this to free up space on your harddrive.
