## Project Set Up
1. Launch Adobe Premiere 
1. Create a New Project in Adobe Premiere
    * Project Name: Use a Conventional Naming Scheme ``YYYY-MM Project Name``
    * Location:``Google Drive/My Drive/Digital Design/YYYY-MM PROJECT/Project Files``
    * Template: None
1. The next screen will have an Import screen. The only important setting to adjust is Sequence Name.
    * Sequence Name: YYYY-MM Project Name-YourLastName *Whatever you name your sequence will become the name of the video you export at the end*
3. You can press skip for now. I prefer to import footage by dragging and dropping from Google Drive Desktop.

## Import Footage
1. Drag the folders containing your assets to the Project Window in the bottom left.

{: .warning }
Premiere does not automatically update the files in a folder. If you add files later on you will have to manually import them in the same way.
