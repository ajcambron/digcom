Every time you log in to a new computer, you will need to make sure that you are signed in to Google Drive for Desktop

## Signing in to Google Drive
1. Before Starting, make sure you are fully logged in to [Google Chrome]({% link resources/5_Google_Chrome/index.md %}), and that your account is set to sync.
2. The Google Drive App should already be installed on your computer. If you do not find it at 'Applications/Google Drive' ask your teacher for assistance
2. When the app opens click "Get Started"
3. Click on "Sign in with Google Account"
4. This should automatically launch a window in Google Chrome. The prompt will ask you to please select your Google Account. Select your school account.
5. It will ask you to verify that you downloaded this app from Google. Click "Sign In"
6. You should then receive a notification that says "Success" indicating that Google Drive is signed in.
7. Google Drive will then ask you which folders you would like to sync. You can say "Skip" for all the prompts. 
8. Google Drive will start loading your files from the cloud.

## Staying Organized

### Setting up a Digital Design Folder

10. You can find your **Google Drive** by selecting it from **Locations** in the sidebar of the **Finder**
10. Select **My Drive** and create a subfolder called **Digital Design**. You should also create folders to keep your other classes organized.
10. Store everything for this class in your 'Digital Design' folder
11. Right click your 'Digital Design' folder and select **Share with Google Drive**
12. Change the General Access to **Share with Christina School District** and click **Done**
13. This ensures that you never have to worry about enabling sharing permissions to turn in any assignments that are saved in this folder.

### Creating Project folders
1. Create a project subfolder for each assignment in this class. Use the naming convention 'YYYY-MM Project Name'.
2. All your resources and files relating to the project should be saved to the project subfolder. 

## Ensure that Google Drive is syncing
1. If you are unsure if Google Drive is syncing, look for the triangle logo in the top right corner of the menu bar. If the icon is greyed out, you will need to sign in again
2. If the logo is not appearing in the menu bar, Google Drive has crashed and needs to be re-opened from the Finder
