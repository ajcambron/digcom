## Plan
1. Gather the resources you need to create your edit.
    - Script
    - Footage
    - Graphics
    - Sound Effects

{% include premieresetup.md %}


## Assembly Edit
1. Import your footage into your bin by dragging and dropping the folders you created earlier
2. Use your script to create an offline edit of the scene.
3. Maintain the original spirit of the scene, and try to be as true to the original vision as possible.
4. Try not to overly concern yourself with being frame accurate. The goal is to create an assembly that tells the story

## Offline Edit
1. Finetune the edit to clean up transitions and pacing. 
2. Bring in music, sound effects, and audio to bring your story to life.

## Online Edit
1. Perfect your cuts.
2. Mix Audio and apply filters and effects.
3. Adjust color correction to balance the look between shots.
4. Add graphics and titles. 
5. Crossfade all audio stems.
6. Fade in and out to black.
