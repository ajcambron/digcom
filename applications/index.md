# Applications of Digital Design


## Learning Outcomes

Course knowledge and skills (what students will know and be able to do):

1. Apply the basic elements and principles of design to:
   1.  identify basic elements of design including line, shape, color, value, texture, mass;
   2. explain the principles of design including balance, alignment, contrast, unity, proportion;
   3. demonstrate how to use basic elements and principles that are appropriate to various design modalities;
   4. interpret the four basic Design Layout Principles of proximity, alignment, repetition, contrast, the rule of thirds and the Rule of Phi;
   5. construct solutions to visual design problems using fundamental principles of design such as formal reference, touching, overlapping, spatial depth, and perspective;
   6. analyze various design materials for their use of levels of messaging;
   7. and develop design materials that demonstrate the use of the elements and principles of design both in print and digital production.
2. Employ project planning, project management, and teamwork as they pertain to the design of visual communication projects incorporating vector graphics to:
   1.  interpret the purpose, audience, and audience needs for preparing images that meet design brief requirements;
   1.  communicate design plans with other members of the design team and clients;
   1.  discuss standard copyright rules for images and image use;
   1.  describe project management tasks and responsibilities;
   1.   and create a review and redesign cycle based on feedback and the design process previously learned.
