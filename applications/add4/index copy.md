## Vocabulary

Keyframe
: A frame that defines the starting or ending point of a smooth transition or movement in an animation.

Ease (Easing)

Composition (Comp)
: The container or workspace where all your layers, effects, and animation come together (often used in software like After Effects).

Layer
: A single element (like text, an image, or video) in a composition that can be animated and manipulated independently.

Anchor Point

Compositing
: The process of combining multiple visual elements (videos, images, graphics) into a single, cohesive scene.

Mask
: A path used to selectively cut out or hide parts of a layer, controlling what is visible.

Mattes/Track Mattes
