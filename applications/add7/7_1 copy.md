## Deliverable

* Breakdown the camera angles and framing within one music video. Try to determine all the camera setups that were used to create this one music video (you do not need to include duplicates, or when the camera only moved slightly in position).
* Screenshot a frame for each setup within the music video.
* Label and identify the angle (**high**, **low**, **eye level**, **drone**) and the framing (**CU**, **MCU**, **Wide**, **UW**, **ECU**... etc).
* Share your breakdown to the discussion board.
