# 8.3 | Purpose and Description
With your group members write a one page purpose and description statement for you video.

This document should be:

* 12 point
* Times New Roman
* Double Spaced
* 1" Margins

2. Purpose (1 short paragraph)
Explain why you created this project.

Include:
* The main goal or message of your video
* The audience you are trying to reach
* The reason you chose this topic or concept

Guiding Questions:
* What do I want viewers to think, feel, or understand after watching?
* How does this connect to something meaningful to me or to society?

Example:
The purpose of this project is to raise awareness about the impact of social media on self-esteem among teenagers. I wanted to encourage students to reflect on how online validation affects their sense of identity.

3. Description (1–3 paragraphs)

Explain what your video includes and how it was created.
Include:

* A brief summary of the storyline or structure
* Key scenes or creative choices (camera angles, editing techniques, sound, or design)
* The production process: planning, filming, and editing steps

Guiding Questions:

* What is the video about?
* How did I use visuals, sound, or pacing to tell the story?
* What software or tools did I use?

Example:
The video follows two parallel stories—one student online and one offline—to show contrast between real and digital life. I used cross-cutting and color grading to emphasize the difference between the two worlds. Music and silence were used intentionally to shift tone.

4. Intended Outcome / Reflection (1 paragraph)
* Wrap up by discussing what you learned and what you hope your audience gains.

Include:
* What you learned about filmmaking or storytelling
* Any challenges and how you solved them
* How the final product represents your skills or growth

Example:
Through this project, I learned how to manage a full editing timeline and improve my color correction skills. My goal is for viewers to feel empathy for students affected by social media pressure and to think about their own online habits.
