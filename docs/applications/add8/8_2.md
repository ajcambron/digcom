# 8.2 | Storyboarding

## Annotate your Script
* Carefully review your entire script.
* Highlight key actions, camera angles, sound cues, and transitions.
* Think visually — what does each scene look like through the camera?

## Break your script into Shot Units
* Go through your script and identify the major shots needed.
* A new shot is usually needed when the camera angle changes or a new action occurs.
* Plan for approximately 15–30 shots total for a 2–6 minute film.

## Draw your Storyboards
* Draw what the camera will see.
   * Stick figures and basic shapes are fine.
   * Focus on composition (where characters are in the frame, what the viewer sees).
* Include the following below or next to each frame:
   * Scene/Shot Number
   * Shot Type (e.g., close-up, wide shot, POV)
   * Camera Movement, if any (e.g., pan, zoom, handheld)
   * Action Summary (What’s happening in this shot?)
   * Key Dialogue or sound cues (music, effects)
   * Notes on lighting, mood, or special effects, if relevant

## Match Shots to the Scripts
* Make sure each storyboard frame corresponds directly to your script.
* You don’t have to draw every line of dialogue — focus on what’s visually important.

## Include Scene Transitions
* Mark how each shot transitions to the next (e.g., cut, dissolve, fade).
* Consider how pacing and rhythm affect your storytelling.

## Review Your Storyboard
* Check for clarity, continuity, and flow.
* Can someone understand your story just by looking at the storyboard?
* Revise to improve weak or confusing areas.

# Submit your Storyboards=
* Upload photographs or digital versions of your storyboards to the discussion board.
