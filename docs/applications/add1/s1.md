# S | 1 | Explainer Video
Using the pre-production materials you have prepared during this unit, you are now tasked with shooting and editing your explainer video.

## Plan
1. Gather everything you need to make your shoot a success
2. Download the [Blackmagic Camera](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagiccamera){:target="_blank"} App for your phone, and configure it for compatibility
    1. Set the codec to H.264 for compatibility with Google Vids
    2. Turn on the guides so that you can frame your shots using the rule-of-thirds.
3. Begin shooting early enough that you will have time in class to edit and ask questions.
    
## Shoot
1. Work your way through the shots you listed in your two-column script
2. Try to work efficiently, shooting all the shots that take place in the same location at the same time.
3. Give your clips pre and post roll so that you have time to cut before and after action.

## Organize
1. Create a Project Directory (Folder) in your Google Drive
2. Try to keep all of your project files for the explainer video together, so your work is not interrupted due to technical difficulties.

## Edit
1. Import your footage into your web-based editor of choice:
    1. [Google Vids](https://docs.google.com/videos){:target="_blank"}
    2. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/video-editor/){:target="_blank"}
    3. [Adobe Express](https://www.adobe.com/express/create/video){:target="_blank"}
2. Edit the video in a logical order that begins with an introduction and ends with a conclusion
3. Add transitions and effects to ease the flow of the content and keep your audience engaged.

## Deliver
1. Export your final sequence to an H.264 .mp4 file
2. Place the export in a sub-directory of your Project Directory
3. Embed the video in your Portfolio Website on its own page
4. Add a project description
5. Submit the published portfolio page to your LMS (Schoology)
