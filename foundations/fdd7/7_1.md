# Deliverable
Create a digital inspiration board (e.g., in Google Slides or Canva) showcasing 5–7 images that you find inspiring with brief annotations explaining how each piece influences your idea of how you would like to create your final stained glass piece. Share your work to the discussion board on Schoology

Each board must include:

* 5–7 images (mix of stained glass and low poly examples)
* Brief annotations (2–3 sentences per image) explaining:
    * What you find inspiring about the piece
    * How it will influence your final stained glass design
    * Any specific colors, shapes, or themes you want to incorporate

* Be sure to let your creativity shine as you create your layouts and clearly organize your thoughts.
