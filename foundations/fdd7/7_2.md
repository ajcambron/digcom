# Lesson Objectives & CTE Standards Alignment

| Lesson Objectives | CTE Standards Alignment |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Develop proficiency in Adobe Illustrator** by creating geometric shapes, using the Pen Tool, and applying color gradients/transparency. | ACCTC.02.01 – Apply artistic elements and principles in the development of creative projects. |
| **Apply low poly art techniques** to create 3–5 practice designs, such as gemstones, animals, or abstract patterns. | ACCTC.04.01 – Develop a portfolio that reflects artistic growth and professional presentation. |
| **Demonstrate an understanding of vector-based design principles**, including anchor points, paths, and layers. | ACCTC.03.01 – Evaluate and critique artistic work using professional terminology and concepts. |

## Reference Materials

* Example low poly designs (e.g., gemstones, animals, abstract patterns)
    * Creating geometric shapes in Illustrator
    * Using the Pen Tool for custom shapes
    * Applying gradients, transparency, and layer management

# Lesson Activities

## 1. Introduction & Demonstration

* Brief overview of **low poly art** and its geometric style.
* Instructor-led demonstration of key Adobe Illustrator techniques:
    * Drawing geometric shapes (Polygon Tool, Rectangle Tool)
    * Using the **Pen Tool** to create custom shapes
    * Applying **gradients** and **transparency** for depth
* Quick class discussion: *Where do we see low poly art in digital media (games, posters, branding)?*

## 2. Hands-On Mini-Tasks

Students complete a **series of guided exercises** in Illustrator:

1.  **Basic Shape Creation:** Draw triangles and polygons, adjusting size and angles.
2.  **Pen Tool Practice:** Trace over a reference image to create a low poly structure.
3.  **Gradient & Transparency Application:** Apply gradients and adjust transparency to enhance depth.
4.  **Color Scheme Tool:** Apply gradients and adjust transparency to enhance depth.

## 3. Independent Practice – Low Poly Designs

* Students apply their skills to create **3–5 low poly practice designs**, such as:
    * A gemstone (multi-faceted, using gradients)
    * An animal (simplified with geometric shapes)
    * An abstract pattern (custom arrangement of polygons)
* Instructor provides feedback and assistance as needed.

## 4. Submission & Reflection

* Students submit their Illustrator file with **all practice designs included**.
* Peer showcase: Students briefly present one design to a partner or small group.
* Reflection discussion:
    * *What challenges did you face while using the Pen Tool?*
    * *How did gradients or transparency affect your final look?*
