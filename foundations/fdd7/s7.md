# Designing Stained Glass Windows with Low Poly Art in Adobe Illustrator

Students will design stained glass windows using the low poly art style as inspiration, creating geometric patterns in Adobe Illustrator. Throughout the project, students will explore digital design techniques, art history, and storytelling through visual art while developing technical skills in vector graphics and design principles.

## Project Idea

| Driving Question | How can we blend the modern aesthetic of low poly art with the traditional craft of stained glass window design using digital tools? |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Learning Goals** | * Apply the fundamentals of basic color theory in a series of simple design projects; <br> * Analyze professional and peer level designs for use of color theory to enhance audience understanding. <br> * Utilize formatting techniques including primary format requirements, design format for print and web, resolution print and web <br> * Use Adobe Illustrator to create vector graphics by using the pen, shape, gradient, and direct selection tools. |
| **Project Summary** | Students will design stained glass windows using the low poly art style as inspiration, creating geometric patterns in Adobe Illustrator. |
| **Major Products** | Students will print and produce vinyl window clings that showcase their artwork |
| **Making it Public** | Students will publish their works to a portfolio website and share their work out to classmates in the form of a gallery walk. |

# Project Path

## Intro

* Introduction to stained glass windows and their historical/cultural significance.
* Exploration of low poly art and its geometric nature as a modern artistic expression.
* Hands-on activity: Analyze stained glass and low poly artworks, identifying geometric patterns and color use.
* Essential Question Brainstorm: What stories or emotions can be conveyed through geometric art?

## Research

* Adobe Illustrator Basics: Understanding the workspace, tools, and vector graphics.
* Low Poly Technique: Using the Pen Tool and Polygon Tool to create triangular facets.
* Color Theory & Lighting: Study color schemes, transparency, and how light interacts with stained glass.
* Practice Task: Recreate a simple stained glass pattern using low poly techniques in Illustrator.

## Develop

* Ideation: Sketch initial designs on paper or digitally, focusing on storytelling through shapes and colors.
* Digital Creation: Translate sketches into vector art in Adobe Illustrator, applying low poly techniques.
* Peer Feedback: Conduct design reviews to refine artwork, ensuring clarity and visual impact.

## Implement

* Finalize Designs: Adjust colors, shapes, and transparency effects to enhance stained glass appearance.
* Artist Statement: Write a short reflection on the design process, meaning behind the artwork, and lessons learned.
* Public Presentation: Organize an exhibition, inviting the school community or hosting an online gallery.

## Reflect

* Group discussion on challenges faced and skills gained.
* Self-assessment: Reflect on personal growth in both technical skills and artistic expression.
* Peer and teacher feedback to celebrate achievements and identify future learning opportunities.
