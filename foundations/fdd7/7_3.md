# Lesson Activities

## 1. Introduction & Inspiration

* Discuss the artistic and symbolic significance of stained glass windows in various cultures and historical contexts.
* Show examples of stained glass windows and highlight elements such as:
    * Composition and panel structure
    * Use of color and light
    * Narrative or symbolic meaning
* Quick class discussion: *What themes or stories do stained glass windows often depict?*

## 2. Sketching the Design

* Students begin their initial sketches by outlining the window composition.
* Emphasize the importance of **clear, bold shapes** and sections that mimic stained glass paneling.
* Encourage students to explore different layouts (e.g., circular rose windows, rectangular panels).

## 3. Developing the Color Scheme

* Students research and choose a color palette inspired by stained glass traditions.
* Considerations include:
    * Warm vs. cool colors for emotional impact
    * Contrast and harmony for visibility and depth
    * Symbolic meaning of colors in art and history
* Students apply color swatches to their sketches using colored pencils or digital tools.

## 4. Written Explanation of Meaning & Symbolism

* Students write a short explanation (5–10 sentences) covering:
    * The meaning or story behind their design
    * Why they chose specific colors and shapes
    * How their design connects to stained glass traditions
* Peer exchange: Students pair up and briefly discuss their artistic choices with a partner.
