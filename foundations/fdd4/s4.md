# Project Path
## Ideation
To come up with ideas that are meaningful to you, start by generating a number of concept statements by doing some freewriting about:
* observations you have been making about life
* observations you have been making about human behavior
* a feeling you have been feeling and why you might be feeling it
* an issue you are passionate about
* something that does not sit well with you

## Reference Photo
[[File:ref_vector_portrait.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An example of a reference photo]]
#### Take a medium close-up or close-up photo of yourself
* Medium Close-Up Falls between a Medium Shot and a Close-Up, generally framing the subject from chest or shoulder up.
* Close-Up Fills the screen with part of the subject, such as a personâ€™s head/face. Framed this tightly, the emotions and reaction of a character dominate the scene.

#### As you take the photograph of yourself, consider the following questions:
* What strong identifiers such as age, attire, cultural connections, mood/expression would you like to emphasize?
* What is being expressed by your pose (frontal, profile, or partly turned)?
* Where are you looking?
* Are you establishing direct eye contact with the viewer?
* Are your eyes downcast?
* Are you looking at other subjects within the artwork?
* What is the color scheme, and how will it influence what I am trying to communicate?


## Outline
[[File:nobackground_vector_portrait.png|thumb|left|200px|Initial Linework]]
[[File:Project_settings_vector_portrait.png|thumb|right|200px|How to configure your project settings]]
* Open the photograph of yourself in Adobe Illustrator and create the linework of your main subject.
    * You should feel comfortable using the pen and shape tools at this point. If not, review the concepts learned in the pen and shape tool exercises in class.
* You may find it helpful to create the outline of your shapes before adding colors to your design. (Use fill color: none)


## Add Detail
[[File:outline_vector_portrait.png|thumb|left|200px|A version with a woodland background]]
* Begin to integrate middle and background imagery
* Images used to create the background do not have to come from the original image background
* Consider repeating, copying and flipping objects to create texture in the background

### Color
