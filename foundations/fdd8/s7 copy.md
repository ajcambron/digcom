# Concepts

## Margins

These new document settings above will create a two page spread for the yearbook that is within spec for our NHS Yearbook. (Refer to the *New Document Settings for a yearbook layout* image for a visual guide).

* **Units:** Picas
* **Width:** 48p
* **Height:** 62p
* **Pages:** 2
    * **Facing Pages:** Yes
    * **Start\#:** 2
* **Columns:** 12
    * **Column Gutter:** 1p
* **Margins:**
    * **Top:** 3p
    * **Bottom:** 6p
    * **Inside:** 1p
    * **Outside:** 3p
* **Bleed:**
    * **Top:** 4p
    * **Bottom:** 4p
    * **Inside:** 0p
    * **Outside:** 4p
* **Slug:** 0p

## Setting Margins in InDesign

* Margins are specified when creating a **new document in InDesign**.
* Select the **chain button** to **unlink proportions**.

## Grid Systems

For this layout, the quantity of horizontal grids are created as column margins. For this assignment, you should take what you have learned about page layout and **experiment with different solutions**.

There is no right or wrong quantity of vertical divisions, but in order to create **unity**, try to keep your gutters to a uniform **1p**.

If you would still like to add vertical grids, you can use the **Layout** > **Create Guides Tool** to add rows to your layout. Experiment with the quantity of rows until you find a subdivision that you like. (Be sure to select **Fit Guides to: Margins**)

# Process

## Grids

* Use the concept of **grid systems** to help you layout your text. (Think **Unity on the Grid**)
1.  Begin by laying down placeholder frames by using the **Rectangle Frame Tool (F)**.
2.  Create a **harmonious pattern** of rectangular frames. Experiment with using multiple frames to create larger "multi-image" frames.
3.  Ensure that your **gutters** (the space between rectangles) are **congruent** across the page.

*(Refer to the **An example of a layout using wireframes** image.)*

## Placeholder Content

1.  Use **text boxes** to create columns for the articles and image captions. Generally, the article should be **3–4 columns wide**, with the captions occupying less space on the page.
2.  Choose **no more than two** harmonious fonts.
3.  Create a **visual hierarchy** that includes **no more than 3 point sizes**. (9, 12, 20 is a good starting place).
4.  Find placeholder graphics on **Pexels.com** to help you fill your page.

*(Refer to the **An example of a rough page with placeholder content** image.)*

## Refine

### Background Color/Images

* To set a page background, create a rectangle shape that fills the **bleed area** (red margins outside of the page).
* Send the rectangle to the background (**Right Click** > **Arrange** > **Send to Back**).

*(Refer to the images demonstrating dragging the rectangle to the bleed line and sending it to the back.)*

### Gradient Fill

* Create a color scheme and apply styles to text and background.
1.  Use **gradient fills** to create more dynamic pages.
2.  Use lines and shapes that **organize the information** and relate **thematically** to the page.

*(Refer to the images demonstrating how to set and adjust a gradient fill.)*

## Vector Images

* Use vector images to add **organic lines** to your page and create **contrast**.
1.  Use the **text wrap function** to make your text wrap the outline of your SVG graphics (**Window** > **Text Wrap**).

*(Refer to the image demonstrating how to wrap text around a vector image.)*

## Deliver

* Export the page as a **.PDF** (**File** > **Export** > **Adobe Print PDF**).
*(Refer to the **An example of a final 2-page spread** image for an example of a final product.)*
* Convert PDF to .PNG for web distribution using Preview
