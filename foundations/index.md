    1. identify basic elements of design including line, shape, color, value, texture, mass;
    1. explain the principles of design including balance, alignment, contrast, unity, proportion;
    1. demonstrate how to use basic elements and principles that are appropriate to various design modalities;
    1. interpret the four basic Design Layout Principles of proximity, alignment, repetition, contrast, the rule of thirds and the Rule of Phi;
    1. construct solutions to visual design problems using fundamental principles of design such as formal reference, touching, overlapping, spatial depth, and perspective;
    1. analyze various design materials for their use of levels of messaging;
    1. and develop design materials that demonstrate the use of the elements and principles of design both in print and digital production.
2. Create views and models of projects using scale, proportion, and measurement techniques to:
    1. apply scale to sketches and layouts in sketchbooks and design assignments;
    1. recognize formal reference, touching, overlapping, spatial depth, and perspective; understand scale creation and mathematics;
    1. and use a scale ruler to translate actual measurements to scale measurements.
3. Develop packaging and promotional design for a product that conforms to specific branding requirements to:
    1. create samples of packaging using naming, logo design, and positioning conventions through digital and print development;
    1. generate a branding campaign to expand a projectâ€™s reach into various markets through media application and variety;
    1. explain and fabricate samples of product identity development such as container and packaging design;

    1. identify target markets and audiences, as well as how to use graphic design to appeal to those target markets;
    1. and demonstrate the use of branding development from conceptualization to production.
4. Assess samples of page design, magazine structure, packaging, and visual display to understand their structures, and construct samples that are effective in conveying information to:
    1. examine samples of page design, magazine structure, packaging, and visual display to understand their structures;
    1. describe levels of messaging: primary (direct level), sublevels, target audience, and audience connection (intellect, emotion, nostalgia, memorable devices);
    1. analyze the three aspects of successful composition pertaining to delivery of message, use of the elements and principles, and aesthetically pleasing content;
    1. develop a morgue file of creative solutions to visual problems that will serve as an idea library;
    1. and develop a concept-oriented problem solving process.
5. Utilize color theory and typography to enhance and further develop design skills through realistic assignment development to:
    1. describe the basic components of typographic forms through specific vocabulary use and identification of features;
    1. identify typography traits including set width, point size, counter space, serif, uppercase, lowercase, stem, stress, stroke, hairline, base line, waistline, ascender line, descender line, ascender, descender;
    1. recognize type styles including bold, italic, regular, condensed;
    1. identify various typefaces through analysis and introductory level typeface design including serif, sans serif, square serif, cursive/script, decorative/novelty, black letter;
    1. apply the fundamentals of basic color theory in a series of simple design projects;
    1. apply the concept of the color wheel and primary, secondary, tertiary colors; explain the use of subtractive and additive color in design development using color terminology;
    1. classify color schemes of complementary, monochromatic, dichromatic, analogous, and triadic;
    1. and analyze professional and peer level designs for use of typography and color theory to enhance audience understanding.
6. Compose, execute, and present projects that clarify and visually communicate a concept to a client while making use of constructive criticism to:
    1. develop poise and presentation skills through a series of increasingly formal project presentations;
    1. identify key elements of a solution to a visual communications problem that would be most effectively presented to a potential client;
