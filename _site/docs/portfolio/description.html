<h3 id="adobe-illustrator-class-project-individual-no-ai-tools">Adobe Illustrator, Class Project, Individual, No AI Tools</h3>
<p>For this project we were asked to create abstract designs in Adobe Illustrator using the concepts of Line, Shape, Texture and Color. This piece represents my Shape design. During this assignment, I learned how to use the pen and blob brush tools in Adobe Illustrator. In the future I would like to learn to use more advanced shading techniques. This project pushed me to explore black and white abstract design which was completely outside of my comfort zone.</p>
