Like Layers, the track on top is visible and can be blended on layers below it.</dd>
  <dt>Transitions</dt>
  <dd>The way clips interact to create a sense of visual harmony/disharmony</dd>

<h2 id="editing-conventions">Editing Conventions</h2>

<h3 id="editing-for-continuity">Editing for Continuity</h3>
<p>The continuity style is characterized by the experience of a smoothly flowing, seamless narrative–one that is visibly continuous and where we tend not to notice the gaps and breaks of scene changes, editing, and subtitles. Continuity editing is a system or grammar for organizing shots with the goal of maintaining the viewer’s spatial orientation and temporal orientation. The continuity system is geared toward maintaining engagement and reducing self-consciousness of the act of viewing.</p>

<h3 id="covering-a-scene">Covering a Scene</h3>
<p>In order to provide the editor with a variety of shots to choose from, conventional filmmaking frequently makes use of the following shot types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Establishing Shot</li>
  <li>Master Take</li>
  <li>Shot/Reverse Shot</li>
  <li>Cut Away</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="180-degree-rule">180 degree rule</h3>
<p>When filming/editing dialogue, the idea that the camera should only move on one side of the axis of action. This establishes a sense of space that preserves continuity.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-edits">Types of Edits</h3>
<p>In order to create visual harmony (continuity), film editors rely on these basic types of edits.</p>
